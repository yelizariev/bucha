Ivan's unit was poorly armed. For nine people, there was only one rifle, grenade, and a couple of binoculars. Ivan and his comrades took shifts at the checkpoint on Yablunska Street. In Ukrainian, the name translates to "Apple Street," due to the trees that line most of its nearly six-kilometer length. In peacetime, it's a pleasant area with a fishing lake. Some houses overlook fields and orchards.
