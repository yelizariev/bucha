Three days later, on February 27th, Russian troops approached the outskirts of Bucha. Almost immediately, they fell into a devastating ambush by Ukrainian artillery. A column of Russian paratroopers took positions on Vokzalna Street when the roar of shells erupted. They temporarily retreated. However, they were angry, believing that someone from the local residents had informed the Ukrainian military of their whereabouts.

"We were on duty at checkpoints, checking documents, and ensuring people weren't carrying weapons," Ivan recalls. "We helped organize the safe departure of people because we knew the area well."
