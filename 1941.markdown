When it all began early in the morning of February 24th, Ivan was driving his taxi through Kyiv. He heard explosions. The dispatcher called and said that all taxis had to return to base.

Forty-three-year-old Ivan took on any job to support his wife and four children. He drove a taxi and sometimes did house repairs. That morning, his first thought was to grab the family's documents. If they were planning to flee, they would need passports. He quickly drove 40 kilometers towards Brovary, where they lived, and from there to Bucha, where his wife and children were staying with his mother. The family was supposed to live there until they figured out a plan for their next steps.
