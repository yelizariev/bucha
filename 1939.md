I meet Ivan Skiba in a small Polish village, where he has found refuge for his family. He has a job. The children live in a place where they don't have to fear. Warm weather has arrived, and in the evenings, the family strolls to the local park, where Ivan fishes in the lake. The bruises on his face and body have healed. But at night, when everyone sleeps, the wounds of memory reopen. Ivan Skiba is a man risen from the dead.
