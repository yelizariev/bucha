    LOVE FOR ENEMIES:
    <br/>"You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
    <br/>
    <br/>GIVING TO THE NEEDY:
    <br/>"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
    <br/>
    <br/>So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."
    <br/>
    <br/>PRAYER:
    <br/>"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him."
    <br/>
    <br/>FASTING:
    <br/>"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."
    <br/>
    <br/>TREASURES IN HEAVEN:
    <br/>"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
    <br/>
    <br/>THE EYE:
    <br/>"The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!"
    <br/>
    <br/>SERVING TWO MASTERS:
    <br/>"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
    <br/>
    <br/>DO NOT WORRY:
    <br/>"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?"
    <br/>
    <br/>JUDGING OTHERS:
    <br/>"Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye."

    <br/>ASK, SEEK, KNOCK:
    <br/>"Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
    <br/>
    <br/>Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."
    <br/>
    <br/>THE NARROW AND WIDE GATES:
    <br/>"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."
    <br/>
    <br/>TRUE AND FALSE PROPHETS:
    <br/>"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them."
    <br/>
    <br/>THE WISE AND FOOLISH BUILDERS:
    <br/>"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash."
    <br/>
    <br/>CONCLUSION:
    <br/>"When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law."

    <br/>Sure, let's continue:
    <br/>
    <br/>HEALING OF A LEPER:
    <br/>When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
    <br/>
    <br/>Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. Then Jesus said to him, “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”
    <br/>
    <br/>THE FAITH OF THE CENTURION:
    <br/>When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. “Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.”
    <br/>
    <br/>Jesus said to him, “Shall I come and heal him?”
    <br/>
    <br/>The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
    <br/>
    <br/>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
    <br/>
    <br/>Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.” And his servant was healed at that moment.
    <br/>
    <br/>JESUS HEALS MANY:
    <br/>When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.
    <br/>
    <br/>When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
    <br/>
    <br/>“He took up our infirmities
    <br/>and bore our diseases.”
    <br/>
    <br/>FOLLOWING JESUS:
    <br/>When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
    <br/>
    <br/>Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”
    <br/>
    <br/>Another disciple said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
    <br/>
    <br/>But Jesus told him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”
    <br/>
    <br/>JESUS CALMS THE STORM:
    <br/>Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to drown!”
    <br/>
    <br/>He replied, “You of little faith, why are you so afraid?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
    <br/>
    <br/>The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!”
    <br/>
    <br/>THE DEMON-POSSESSED MEN:
    <br/>When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. “What do you want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?”
    <br/>
    <br/>Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. The demons begged Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”
    <br/>
    <br/>He said to them, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.

    <br/>My dear excellent جنان!
    <br/>
    <br/>This is the last time I attach a postcard to your mailbox. My mental surgery is over. I've successfully removed the broken parts. I've replaced the missing parts with your character. Because <u class="revolution">You</u>😍<u class="MagicREVOLUTION">Amazing</u>.
    <br/>
    <br/>Since now, every time on social contact I just ask myself: "what  جنان would do in such a situation". Then I just do it your way. I have quite a good understanding of your personality. I have copied pretty much everything I know about you (except to your opinion about Jerusalem). Because <u class="revolution">You</u>😍<u class="MagicREVOLUTION">Amazing</u>.
    <br/>
    <br/>My dark side is dead. It resisted the change and I made quite a few mistakes. I'm sorry about what happened, about what I said or did. I'm sorry about involving you with my mental revolution. It's over. I believe it's over. I hope I'm not that bad anymore.
    <br/>
    <br/>It was a pleasure to meet you  جنان.
    <br/><u class="revolution">Heaven</u>😍<u class="MagicREVOLUTION">Shower</u> down blessing on you...
    <br/>
    <br/><u class="MagicREVOLUTION">Good</u>💋<u class="revolution">Bye</u>,
