    My dear princess of üá±üáßLebanonüá±üáß!
    <br/>
    <br/>This is the last time I put a letter into your mailbox. I believe I found the line of code in my psyche that blocked development of my personality.
    <br/>
    <br/>I'm going to upgrade my mind with a special mental surgery. It's a bit risky but like in the Jewish story of Masada mountain ‚Äî what is the point of living if you cannot love your people in a way you want.
    <br/>
    <br/>I'm going to visit the Kingdom of Lebanon <a class="nomagic" href="https://moses.lamourism.com/mossad/love-station.jpg?debug=üáÆüá±">Next Monday</a> and check if the local falafel in Beirut is as good as the one in Tel Aviv. The flight is from Paris. My journey starts there this weekend. God only knows what happens after.
    <br/>
    <br/>I hope that my mental surgery will successfully fix my mind and I'll be able to have more friends with benefits than Habib does in Namur. Apparently you prefer playboys more than stupid romantics. I know that you also like classical boyfriends like Aliya's <a class="nomagic" href="https://github.com/yelizariev?debug=assets">fool</a>, but they are just too fucking boring. Well, at least until they know the terrible truth about Habib.
    <br/>
    <br/>Farewell, my dear, excellent Jini. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.
    <br/>
    <br/>Your affectionate Little Prince from the <b>MagicüòçPlanet</b>
